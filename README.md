# Boba-Machine

The Bobaneers Boba Machine allows a user to order a cup of bubble tea made fresh according to their tea, milk, and flavor preferences!

The machine is controlled by 3 subsystems:
1. Move Cup via Assembly Line
2. Pump Tea + Flavor
3. Tapioca Pearls (Boil + Sugar Soak)

Each subsystem correlates to an Arduino Uno and script.
